# ScoreTrackerBackend
## Overview
This is a really crappy backend for ScoreTrackerAng2 written in Typescript using Node.

Eventually plan to combine this repo with ScoreTrackerAng2, but for now building them separately.

## Current Focus
+ Agricola
+ Games with built-in scoring systems (e.g. Carcassonne)
	+ In this case, this App is used for historical tracking

## Future Plan
+ Player(s) vs the board games (e.g. Pandemic)
	+ Require a different scoring system
